# Website for an image classifier I made

Knowing how to deploy ML/DL models is important as it helps in quick prototyping. Here, I have used Gradio and HuggingFace Spaces to get an API (and a web embed) for my model. I have then used this API in the custom made website that enables to directly upload images and get the labels or results right in the website!
