# Website for an image classifier I made

Knowing how to deploy ML/DL models is important as it helps in quick prototyping. Here, I have used Gradio and HuggingFace Spaces to get an API (and a web embed) for my model. I have then used this API in the custom made website that enables to directly upload images and get the labels or results right in the website!

Here are the links to the HuggingFace Spaces used:
